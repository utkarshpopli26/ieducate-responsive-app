            <p class="sectionsubtag">Education is a process of learning through which we acquire knowledge. It
                enlightens, empowers, and creates a positive development. Education gives an individual the knowledge
                and skills to work with virtue. It aids the all-round mental, physical, and intellectual growth and
                development of an individual.

                There are three distinct types of Education- Formal Education, Non-Formal Education, and Informal
                Education. Education aims to change the way of one’s thinking. Academic knowledge provides one leaning
                on a global scale, while Practical knowledge is acquired for life on the whole.

                Education is imparted to all, at various research and academic institutions, imparted by teachers,
                professors, and trainers.These institutions conduct various curricular activities that aid the overall
                growth and development of students.

                Education boosts and develops the commercial scenario as well as benefits the overall economy of the
                country. Higher the level of education, the better are the chances of development. Therefore, it is
                highly important to educate the children and youth to live a productive life and help in the development
                of society and the nation.

                Education is the backbone of a country. It is an integral tool that aids the development of human
                civilization. Education equips the nation with the workforce, uplifts awareness among the general
                public, and promotes national unity.

                A life without education is valueless. Education makes oneself-sufficient, knowledgeable, intelligent,
                independent and boosts self-confidence. It enhances our thought process and enables us to do things
                creatively and correctly.



                Education promotes national unity through the contributions of the diverse workforce such as Lawyers,
                Doctors, Engineers, Judges, Administrative officials, Teachers, Economists, and other technical hands.

                John Amos Comenius is crowned as the ‘Father of Modern Education’, who put forth various kinds and forms
                of education. According to John Amos, education is not confined within the classrooms. He has written
                various education theories, methods, and systems which states that illusions as students cannot be
                learned only by reading. </p>
